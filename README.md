Cartpole Balancing Bot
Overview
The Cartpole Balancing Bot is a reinforcement learning project implemented in the OpenAI Gym environment using Q-learning. The goal is to balance a pole on a cart moving along a frictionless track by applying appropriate forces. The agent learns to maintain pole stability through trial-and-error, optimizing actions based on rewards.
Features

Environment: OpenAI Gym's CartPole-v1.
Algorithm: Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning method.
Learning Process: The agent receives rewards for keeping the pole upright, refining its policy over episodes.
Visualization: Performance metrics (e.g., episode duration) plotted using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
OpenAI Gym: Simulation environment for the cart-pole system.
NumPy: Numerical computations for Q-table updates.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization for training progress.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/cartpole-balancing-bot.git


Install dependencies:pip install gym numpy matplotlib seaborn


Run the main script:python cartpole_bot.py



Usage

Execute cartpole_bot.py to train the agent.
The script initializes a Q-table, runs training episodes, and saves performance plots.
Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) in the script for experimentation.

Project Timeline

Duration: September 2024 â€“ December 2024
Developed as a demonstration of reinforcement learning for dynamic control problems.

Results

The agent achieves stable pole balancing after sufficient training.
Performance improves over episodes, with longer balancing durations.
